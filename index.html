                <p><strong>Q: Why? </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <strong>A:  </strong> I always have my phone, but never have a notebook to record my workouts. This is my solution for that, while not having to use a boring notepad on the phone itself. Of course this exists already, but not to this
                    extent.

                <p><strong>Q: What Does It Do? </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <strong>A:  </strong> The project's function is to let anyone quickly reference past workouts, store workout schedules into a database from an image, input your workout ones as an image (of a notebook or a screenshot of a workout in
                    notes), compare numbers with previous weeks and see a trend develop as data is inserted. And ultimately give the user a site to go back to to collect, manipulate, view or whatever the user wishes. A window into the Database.</p2>

                <p><strong>Q: Database? </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    <strong>A:  </strong>Yes. Using SQL through Microsoft SQL Management Studio, all information will be stored and accessed through there. This immediately allows for CRUD operations to be performed which is invaluable for data storage
                    and manipulation with ease.</p2>
